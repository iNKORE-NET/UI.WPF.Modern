# iNKORE.UI.WPF.Modern Software License

## License Terms

By using the software "iNKORE.UI.WPF.Modern" (hereinafter referred to as "the Software"), you agree to the following terms and conditions:

### 1. General Restrictions

- **Commercial Use**: You may not incorporate any part of the Software into commercial products without explicit written permission from iNKORE Studios.

- **Distribution**: All software incorporating or referencing the Software must be fully open-source unless otherwise explicitly permitted by a separate agreement. You are free to choose any widely-recognized open-source license for your project. There is no requirement to adopt this specific license for your own software, as long as the chosen license clearly meets the generally accepted definition of "open source."

- **No Endorsement**: Neither the name of the authors (iNKORE Studios and all contributors) nor the name of the Software may be used to endorse or promote products derived from the Software without prior written permission.

- **Commercial Activities Prohibited**: You are prohibited from selling, renting, leasing, or sublicensing the Software.

### 2. Attribution

Any product incorporating the Software must provide clear and visible attribution, including:

- Project Name: **iNKORE.UI.WPF.Modern**
- Authors: **iNKORE Studios and all iNKORE.UI.WPF.Modern contributors**
- Project Repository: [https://github.com/iNKORE-NET/UI.WPF.Modern](https://github.com/iNKORE-NET/UI.WPF.Modern)

This attribution must appear clearly within the product's README file or the "About" section accessible to the end user.

### 3. Modifications and Derivative Works

You are permitted to create modifications and derivative works ("Derivative Works") of the Software subject to the following conditions:

- **Derivative Works with Substantially Similar Purpose**: If a Derivative Work serves substantially the same purpose as the original Software (e.g., creating another WPF control library based on this Software), it must be licensed exclusively under these license terms.
- **Derivative Works with Distinct Purpose**: If a Derivative Work serves a significantly different purpose (e.g., developing an application that utilizes the Software), adoption of this license for your Derivative Work is not required, though compliance with all other terms of this license remains mandatory.

### 4. Prohibited Uses

Under no circumstances may the Software be used in any product or activity:

- Designed for illegal activities, including unauthorized access to computer systems (e.g., hacking or cracking).
- Intended to create malicious software (malware), including viruses, worms, or similar destructive software.
- In violation of copyrights, intellectual property rights, or other legal rights of third parties, including iNKORE Studios and its affiliates.

### 5. Warranty and Liability Disclaimer

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

IN NO EVENT SHALL iNKORE STUDIOS OR ITS CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE.

### 6. Termination

Violation of any term outlined in this license will result in immediate termination of your rights granted under this license. Upon termination, you must cease all use and distribution of the Software immediately.

### 7. Exceptions and Commercial Subscription

Exceptions to the above terms may be granted by iNKORE Studios on a case-by-case basis. For inquiries or permissions, contact [studios@inkore.net](mailto:studios@inkore.net).

A commercial subscription option is available if you require commercial usage rights or are unable to comply fully with these license terms. This subscription is based on a donation model with flexible pricing tailored to your budget.

- It's more like a donation, because we don't profit from that and your donation will go straight to server running and other costs that we're incurring.

- We currently do not limit the charge to a specific amount, so you can choose the amount that fits your budget. Just donate as much as you value our work. We'd be happy to receive a few cups of coffee every month which keeps the project alive.

- We can also provide support and assistance with the project, if needed, discussed on a case-by-case basis.

To discuss and arrange a commercial subscription, contact [studios@inkore.net](mailto:studios@inkore.net).

> We're no charity. We won't let anyone profit off our hard work while we can't even keep ourselves fed and clothed, digging into our own pockets just to barely keep the servers running and development going.

### 8. Contributor Exception

Frequent contributors who substantially aid in developing or maintaining the Software may receive specific exemptions to certain restrictions upon request and approval, determined at the sole discretion of iNKORE Studios. Please contact [studios@inkore.net](mailto:studios@inkore.net) to see if you qualify for such exceptions and discuss further arrangements.
